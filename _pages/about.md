# About initdotbug

Welcome to **initdotbug** - my personal corner of the internet where I document my journey as a developer, share insights, and explore the ever-evolving world of technology.

## Who Am I?

I'm An Van Nguyen ([anvndev](https://anvndev.github.io/)) ‚Äì a passionate developer with a love for clean code, innovative solutions, and continuous learning.  
My interests span across various domains of software development, from mobile app development with **Swift** and **Flutter**, to backend systems with **Golang**, and everything in between.

As a proud **FOSS lover**, I enjoy contributing to and learning from open-source communities. You'll often find me customizing my development workflow with tools like **Neovim**, crafting minimal, efficient setups that reflect both aesthetics and performance.

This blog is where I share what I build, what I break, and everything I learn along the way.
